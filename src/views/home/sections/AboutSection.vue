    <h2>My name is Lukas. I'm a <span style="color: #6080dd">web developer.</span></h2>

      I have a passion for creating web applications. I love the challenge of turning abstract ideas into polished and functional experiences. There's nothing more satisfying than seeing all the pieces come together after carefully structuring the inputs.

      My first experience with coding was in Unity, where I used C# scriptable objects to configure game logic. I picked it up quickly but realized I didn't have a strong vision for any elaborate game projects. Instead, I started experimenting with graphics to visualize mathematical concepts. Later, in upper secondary school, I was introduced to web development and found myself naturally adapting to JavaScript. Seeing the broad impact and possibilities of web technologies, I set my sights on becoming a web developer.

      Currently, I am studying frontend development at IT-Högskolan in Stockholm. I conducted my first internship during the fall of 2025 at TextualAI. There I learned much about coding in a team and also recieved a taste of backend integration with Python. However as a junior developer, my focus is still on continuously growing my knowledge through hands-on practice and experience. Let's connect!
